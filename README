## cosc

A Windows command-line tool for sending and receiving [OSC packets](https://opensoundcontrol.stanford.edu/).

See [Usage]("https://github.com/music-practice-tools/cosc/blob/main/cosc/cosc.cpp#L18"").

Based on [sendosc](https://github.com/yoggy/sendosc) by yoggy which uses [packosc](http://www.rossbencina.com/code/oscpack) by rossbencina.

## Building

Only a Windows version has be included, unlike sendosc, as that's all I needed. The code should be portable.

See Releases for binary.
